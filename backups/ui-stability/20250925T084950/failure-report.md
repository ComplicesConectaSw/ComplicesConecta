# UI Stability Fix - Failure Report

## Branch: fix/ui-stability-20250925T084950-A1
## Timestamp: 2025-09-25T08:49:50

### Status: FAILED - Build Error

### Issue Description
Build failed with esbuild/TypeScript errors after implementing UI stability changes. The NavigationEnhanced component appears to have import/dependency issues.

### Actions Taken Before Failure
1. ✅ Created branch and backup structure
2. ✅ Added stable-element CSS utilities to index.css
3. ✅ Applied stable-element class to NavigationEnhanced
4. ✅ Added Stories/Momentos to HeaderNav
5. ❌ Build failed with esbuild errors

### Root Cause
The NavigationEnhanced.tsx component has missing imports or incorrect hook dependencies:
- `useDemoThemeConfig` hook may not exist
- `getNavbarStyles` function may not exist
- `useFeatures` hook import issues

### Recovery Action
- Reverted to last known good commit: 658b45b
- All changes rolled back to prevent broken state

### Next Steps Required
1. Fix NavigationEnhanced.tsx imports and dependencies
2. Ensure all required hooks exist before applying UI changes
3. Test build after each component modification
4. Apply changes incrementally with build validation

### Files That Need Attention
- `src/components/NavigationEnhanced.tsx` - Import/dependency issues
- `src/hooks/useFeatures.ts` - Verify existence
- `src/hooks/useProfileTheme.ts` - Verify useDemoThemeConfig export

### Build Error Log
```
Exit code: 1
esbuild errors related to missing imports/dependencies
```

### Recommendation
Start with a minimal approach:
1. Fix existing NavigationEnhanced component without adding new dependencies
2. Apply only CSS changes first
3. Test build after each change
4. Add new features incrementally
